These set of classes is used to help along development of a Cocoa (Mac OS X) Twitter client.

As not much code is available for utilising the data received from Twitter.com on the Mac, I decided to develop a set of classes to use the data for an NSTableView and a set of formatted cells.

Feel free to use the code where you like.
